# Applying Conway's Law — Worked Examples

These are conceptual worked examples of the team/system-boundary reasoning this skill applies — useful for understanding the reasoning, but the actual analysis steps are the numbered Workflow steps in the main SKILL.md.

## 1. Identify System Boundaries

```
System Boundaries:


 Order Management System                             
  - Owns: Order entity and its lifecycle             
  - Events: OrderCreated, OrderConfirmed, Cancelled  
  - Owns: Order state machine                        



 Payment Processing System                           
  - Owns: Payment authorization and processing       
  - Events: PaymentAuthorized, PaymentFailed         
  - Owns: Payment state machine                      



 Inventory System                                    
  - Owns: Stock levels and reservations              
  - Events: InventoryReserved, InventoryAllocated    
  - Owns: Inventory state machine                    



 Fulfillment System                                  
  - Owns: Shipments and delivery                     
  - Events: OrderShipped, DeliveryConfirmed          
  - Owns: Shipment state machine                     

```

## 2. Create Swimlane Diagram

```
                Event Stream Timeline
                →

Order Team      OrderCreated   OrderConfirmed   OrderCancelled
                                                   
Payment Team                 PaymentAuthorized    PaymentFailed
                                    
Inventory Team                InventoryReserved
                                    
Fulfillment Team              OrderShipped    DeliveryConfirmed

Each team owns their swimlane events
Coordination via events crossing swimlanes
```

## 3. Map Team Responsibilities

```
Order Management Team
 Commands they handle:
   - CreateOrder
   - ConfirmOrder
   - CancelOrder
 Events they produce:
   - OrderCreated
   - OrderConfirmed
   - OrderCancelled
 Read Models they maintain:
   - OrderStatusView
   - OrderListView
 Systems they call:
    - Payment System (to confirm payment)
    - Inventory System (to check stock)

Payment Processing Team
 Commands they handle:
   - AuthorizePayment
   - ProcessPayment
   - RefundPayment
 Events they produce:
   - PaymentAuthorized
   - PaymentFailed
   - PaymentRefunded
 Read Models they maintain:
   - PaymentStatusView
   - TransactionHistory
 Systems they depend on:
    - Payment Gateway (external)
    - Order System (for context)

Inventory Team
 Commands they handle:
   - ReserveInventory
   - ReleaseReservation
   - AllocateStock
 Events they produce:
   - InventoryReserved
   - ReservationReleased
   - StockAllocated
 Read Models they maintain:
   - InventoryLevelView
   - ReservationView
 Systems they depend on:
    - Order System (triggers)
    - Warehouse System (stock source)

Fulfillment Team
 Commands they handle:
   - CreateShipment
   - MarkShipped
   - ConfirmDelivery
 Events they produce:
   - ShipmentCreated
   - OrderShipped
   - DeliveryConfirmed
 Read Models they maintain:
   - ShipmentTrackingView
   - DeliveryScheduleView
 Systems they depend on:
    - Inventory System (items to ship)
    - Carrier APIs (tracking)
```

## 4. Identify Inter-System Communication

```
Communication Patterns:

Order System  →  Payment System
 Order System produces: OrderConfirmed event
 Payment System consumes: OrderConfirmed
 Payment System reacts: Issues AuthorizePayment command
 Payment System produces: PaymentAuthorized event

Order System  →  Inventory System
 Order System produces: PaymentAuthorized event (indirectly)
 Inventory System consumes: PaymentAuthorized
 Inventory System reacts: Issues ReserveInventory command
 Inventory System produces: InventoryReserved event

Inventory System  →  Fulfillment System
 Inventory System produces: InventoryReserved event
 Fulfillment System consumes: InventoryReserved
 Fulfillment System reacts: Issues CreateShipment command
 Fulfillment System produces: OrderShipped event
```

## 5. Define System Interfaces

```
Order System Interface
 Commands it accepts:
   - CreateOrder (from UI)
   - ConfirmOrder (from UI)
   - CancelOrder (from UI or Processors)
 Events it produces:
   - OrderCreated
   - OrderConfirmed
   - OrderCancelled
 Read Models it provides:
    - OrderStatusView
    - OrderListView

Payment System Interface
 Commands it accepts:
   - AuthorizePayment (from Payment Processor/Order System)
   - ProcessPayment (from Order System)
 Events it produces:
    - PaymentAuthorized
    - PaymentFailed
    - PaymentProcessed

Inventory System Interface
 Commands it accepts:
   - ReserveInventory (triggered by PaymentAuthorized event)
 Events it produces:
    - InventoryReserved
    - InventoryFailed
```

## 6. Identify Processors vs Systems

```
Processors (autonomous automation):

1. PaymentProcessor
   Triggered by: OrderConfirmed event
   Logic: Calls external payment gateway
   Produces: AuthorizePayment command
   Lives in: Payment System

2. InventoryProcessor
   Triggered by: PaymentAuthorized event
   Logic: Checks stock, reserves inventory
   Produces: ReserveInventory command
   Lives in: Inventory System

3. FulfillmentProcessor
   Triggered by: InventoryReserved event
   Logic: Creates shipment records
   Produces: CreateShipment command
   Lives in: Fulfillment System

4. NotificationProcessor
   Triggered by: OrderCreated, OrderConfirmed, OrderShipped events
   Logic: Sends emails/SMS
   Produces: No commands (info-only)
   Lives in: Notification System (cross-cutting)
```

## Event Flow Across System Boundaries

### Flow: Order → Payment → Inventory → Fulfillment

```
Time →

Order System
OrderCreated →
OrderConfirmed →
                              (triggers)
Payment System
PaymentAuthorized →
                       (triggers)
Inventory System
InventoryReserved →
                       (triggers)
Fulfillment System
OrderShipped
DeliveryConfirmed
```

## Team Responsibilities Matrix

| Team | Creates Commands | Produces Events | Owns Read Models |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Order | CreateOrder, ConfirmOrder | OrderCreated, OrderConfirmed | OrderStatusView |
| Payment | AuthorizePayment | PaymentAuthorized | PaymentStatusView |
| Inventory | ReserveInventory | InventoryReserved | InventoryLevelView |
| Fulfillment | CreateShipment | OrderShipped | ShipmentTrackingView |

---

## Inter-System Communication

### Order → Payment
- Trigger: OrderConfirmed event
- Action: Payment System listens via Processor
- Result: AuthorizePayment command issued

### Payment → Inventory
- Trigger: PaymentAuthorized event
- Action: Inventory System listens via Processor
- Result: ReserveInventory command issued

## Dependencies

### External Systems

| System | Owns | Called By | Purpose |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| Payment Gateway | Payment provider | Payment System | Authorization |
| Warehouse | Inventory source | Inventory System | Stock info |
| Carrier API | Shipping | Fulfillment System | Tracking |

---

## Independent Development

Each system can:
- Develop independently
- Use different tech stacks
- Scale independently
- Deploy independently
- Own their events
- Maintain their read models

Coordination via:
- Events (async messaging)
- Processors (listen and react)
- Read models (shared views)
```
