name: handle-comment
description: Place, resolve, or delete a comment on an eventmodelers board node. Action is determined by the first argument: place (default), resolve, or delete.

# Handle Comment

> **Before doing anything else**, invoke the `connect` skill — if not already connected — to resolve `TOKEN`, `BOARD_ID`, `ORG_ID`, and `BASE_URL`. Do not proceed until the connect skill has completed.

Prefer `mcp__eventmodelers__*` tools when available (registered by the `connect` skill) — the curl blocks below are the fallback for sessions without MCP connected.

---

## Step 1 — Parse arguments

From `$ARGUMENTS` or the calling skill's context, extract:

| Field | How to find it | Default |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `action` | First word: `place`, `resolve`, or `delete` | `place` |
| `nodeId` | UUID of the target node | **required** |
| `text` | Comment text (place) or substring to match (resolve/delete) | required for `place`; used to look up comment when `commentId` is absent |
| `commentId` | UUID of the comment to resolve/delete | preferred over `text` for resolve/delete |
| `type` | `COMMENT` or `TASK` | `COMMENT` (place only) |
| `author` | Author identifier string | `agent-$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (place only) |
| `boardId` | Board UUID | from `connect` skill (`BOARD_ID`) |

Use the session env var, not the literal string `agent` — `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is set by the
host for every session, so two agents working the same board at once post under distinguishable
authors instead of an identical one. If the env var is unset (non-Claude-Code host), fall back to
the literal `agent`.

There is no `QUESTION` type at the API level — a question is just a `COMMENT` whose text happens
to be phrased as a question. Callers that want to flag something as a question should word the
`text` accordingly, not pass a special `type`.

Route to the matching section below based on `action`.

## Action: place

**Prefer MCP** — one call, `type` (`COMMENT`/`TASK`) passed straight through:

```
mcp__eventmodelers__add_comment { "boardId": "$BOARD_ID", "nodeId": "$NODE_ID", "text": "<text>", "type": "<COMMENT|TASK>", "author": "<author>" }
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Action: place".

**Batching (when called in bulk, e.g. from `wdyt`):** send one request per comment — there is no batch endpoint for comments. Fire them sequentially, not in a single payload.

**Report:**
```
Comment posted on node <nodeId>
Type: <type> | Author: <author>
"<text>"
```

---

## Action: resolve

**Step A — Resolve comment ID** (skip if `commentId` was provided directly):

**Prefer MCP:**
```
mcp__eventmodelers__get_node_comments { "boardId": "$BOARD_ID", "nodeId": "$NODE_ID" }
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Action: resolve — Step A (resolve comment ID)".

Find the comment whose `text` contains the `text` argument (case-insensitive). If multiple match, list them and ask the user to confirm. If none match, stop: "No comment found matching '<text>' on node `<nodeId>`."

**Step B — Resolve:**

**Prefer MCP:**
```
mcp__eventmodelers__update_comment { "boardId": "$BOARD_ID", "nodeId": "$NODE_ID", "commentId": "$COMMENT_ID", "action": "resolve" }
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Action: resolve — Step B (resolve)".

**Report:** `Resolved comment <commentId> on node <nodeId>`

---

## Action: delete

**Step A — Resolve comment ID** (same lookup as resolve; skip if `commentId` was provided directly).

**Step B — Confirm before deleting:**
```
About to delete comment on node <nodeId>:
"<comment text>"

Confirm? (yes / no)
```
Wait for an explicit "yes". On any other response, stop: "Deletion cancelled."

**Step C — Delete:**

**Prefer MCP:**
```
mcp__eventmodelers__update_comment { "boardId": "$BOARD_ID", "nodeId": "$NODE_ID", "commentId": "$COMMENT_ID", "action": "delete" }
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Action: delete — Step C (delete)".

**Report:** `Deleted comment <commentId> from node <nodeId>`
