# Elaborating Scenarios

> **Before doing anything else**, invoke the `connect` skill — if not already connected — to resolve `TOKEN`, `BOARD_ID`, `ORG_ID`, and `BASE_URL`. Do not proceed until it has completed. Consult `learn-eventmodelers-api` only if you need to look up a specific endpoint or field this file doesn't cover — don't load it eagerly.

This step applies the shared element rules in **`eventmodeling-core-rules`** — read it once per session if you haven't already; it defines what a COMMAND/EVENT/READMODEL/SCREEN/AUTOMATION is, how each is named, and the anti-patterns to reject, so this step doesn't restate them.

Prefer `mcp__eventmodelers__*` tools when available (registered by the `connect` skill) — the curl blocks below are the fallback for sessions without MCP connected.

## GWT vs. Storyline — Decision Rule

A GWT scenario asserts one isolated transition (one precondition → one action → one outcome). A
storyline instead narrates one use case as an ordered sequence of **beats**, walking the *same*
element (usually a read model) through multiple states in one flow — something no single GWT can
express.

**Commands: always GWT.** A command has no state progression to narrate — it validates one
input against one state and either succeeds or is rejected. Never write a storyline for a command.

**Read models: storyline when the read model goes through a series of clear state transitions
driven by events; GWT otherwise.** Decide this **per read model**, not once for the whole pass:
does replaying this read model's actually-connected event(s) more than once produce an interesting
accumulated/changed state worth narrating? A single event type recurring with different data counts
just as much as a multi-event lifecycle — e.g. `AccountFunded($40)` then `AccountFunded($70)`
walking a balance from $40 to $110 is a genuine storyline driver. **Todo lists are a prime
candidate**: an item appears when opened and disappears when completed, which is exactly the kind
of state progression a storyline is for — as is any read model whose rows accumulate, update, or
get removed across a sequence of events (balances, counters, statuses). Yes → storyline. No →
GWT-only. Make this call before drafting any payload — a batch pass that reuses one schema for
every command *and* every read model is a sign the per-read-model judgment got skipped.

Even where a read model gets a storyline, still write GWTs for the specific scenarios the
storyline doesn't cover — validation failures, cross-context sourcing, or any transition outside
the narrated flow. Storyline and GWT are complementary, not exclusive: the storyline covers the
narrated lifecycle, GWT covers everything else about that read model.

**Example** — a customer-activation walkthrough of a Todos read model:
1. **Beat 1** — Todos read model, empty.
2. **Beat 2** — after `CustomerRegistered`, Todos shows one entry ("activate your account").
3. **Beat 3** — after `CustomerActivated`, Todos is empty again (todo completed and removed).

A storyline threads all three beats into one walkthrough; three separate GWTs could each assert one
transition but not the lifecycle.

### Storyline data shape

```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "title": "Customer activation walkthrough",
  "description": "Optional narrative summary",
  "layout": "horizontal",
  "beats": [
    { "instanceId": "<uuid>", "refId": "<readmodel-node-id>", "type": "READMODEL", "title": "Todos", "exampleMode": "list", "expectEmptyList": true, "examples": [] },
    { "instanceId": "<uuid>", "refId": "<event-node-id>", "type": "EVENT", "title": "CustomerRegistered" },
    { "instanceId": "<uuid>", "refId": "<readmodel-node-id>", "type": "READMODEL", "title": "Todos", "exampleMode": "list", "examples": [{"task": "Activate your account"}] },
    { "instanceId": "<uuid>", "refId": "<event-node-id-2>", "type": "EVENT", "title": "CustomerActivated" },
    { "instanceId": "<uuid>", "refId": "<readmodel-node-id>", "type": "READMODEL", "title": "Todos", "exampleMode": "list", "expectEmptyList": true, "examples": [] }
  ]
}
```

- `layout`: `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"` — how the beats are laid out in the storyline editor.
- Each beat has an `instanceId` (unique per beat, even when the same `refId` repeats — this is what
  lets the *same* element, like the Todos read model above, appear multiple times across the
  walkthrough, once per state) and a `refId` (the board node this beat walks through — any element
  type, not just EVENT/COMMAND/READMODEL — e.g. a SCREEN beat to show the resulting UI).
- `isError` marks a beat as an alternate/error branch off the previous beat.
- `fields`, `expectEmptyList`, `exampleMode`, `examples` mirror the same fields GWT scenario steps
  use, letting a beat show concrete example data the same way a "then" readmodel step does.

Post storylines via `POST .../timelines/:tl/columns/:col/storylines` (see `learn-eventmodelers-api`
for the full endpoint contract) — the same auto-create-if-missing SCENARIO spec node scenarios use,
in a sibling `meta.storylines` collection.

## Interview Phase (Optional)

**When to Interview**: Skip if the user has already specified: scenario coverage depth (happy path + validation + state violations), known edge cases to include, and stakeholders available for review. Interview when coverage goals are unclear or edge cases haven't been identified.

### Critical Questions

1. **Scenario Depth & Coverage Goals** (Impact: Determines scope—happy path only vs. comprehensive coverage)
   - Question: "How comprehensive should scenario coverage be? (A) Happy path + basic validation, (B) All command variations, (C) Comprehensive including edge cases and error paths"
   - Why it matters: Affects time investment and implementation complexity; production code needs (C), design validation might use (A) or (B)
   - Follow-up triggers: If (C) → ask "How many scenarios per command is reasonable?"; if (A) → clarify MVP vs. production distinction

2. **Known Edge Cases & Business Rules** (Impact: Ensures critical scenarios aren't missed)
   - Question: "What specific edge cases or business rules are critical to test? (e.g., 'order cancellation within 24 hours', 'payment decline recovery')"
   - Why it matters: Business rules often generate overlooked scenarios; edge cases reveal missing events
   - Follow-up triggers: For each rule → ask "What scenarios demonstrate this rule? What happens when it's violated?"

3. **Testing & Automation Strategy** (Impact: Shapes scenario detail and executable format)
   - Question: "Will these scenarios be: (A) Automated tests, (B) Manual QA reference, (C) Documentation only?"
   - Why it matters: Automated tests need precise Given/When/Then; documentation can be more narrative
   - Follow-up triggers: If (A) → ask about test framework; if (B) → ask about QA process

4. **Stakeholder Review & Validation** (Impact: Determines who validates business logic correctness)
   - Question: "Who will review and validate scenarios? (A) Product Owner, (B) QA/Tester, (C) Multiple roles, (D) Engineering only?"
   - Why it matters: Multi-role review catches business logic errors; single role may miss perspective
   - Follow-up triggers: If (A) only → ask "Will PO have time for detailed review?"; if (C) → plan review workshop

Follow **`eventmodeling-interview-protocol`** to run this interview and record its findings — label this step "**7. Scenarios** (`eventmodeling-elaborating-scenarios`)". Findings should cover: coverage goals, critical edge cases, business rules requiring scenarios, testing strategy, review/validation plan, and the key scenario specifications themselves (GWT format for critical commands and views).

Scenarios are done, but the model is not yet ready for implementation — Steps 8–11
(Completeness, Validation, Slicing, Documentation) still follow. Proceed to Step 8
(`eventmodeling-checking-completeness`).

## Workshop Facilitation Guide

**Context**: Scenarios are created in a collaborative workshop with multiple stakeholders. Use this approach for rapid, real-time scenario creation:

### Before the Workshop

**Participants** (required roles):
- **Product Owner/Domain Expert**: Knows business rules, priorities, edge cases
- **Developer**: Technical feasibility, implementation concerns
- **QA/Tester**: Test coverage, edge cases, error scenarios
- **Facilitator**: Keeps pace, ensures shared understanding, captures scenarios

**Setup**:
- Whiteboard or collaborative tool (Miro, Figma, etc.)
- Sticky notes or digital cards for scenarios
- Previously completed steps: Events timeline and system boundaries
- Timer for time-boxing per command/view

### During Workshop (Per Command/View)

**Rapid Cycle** (15-20 min per command):
1. **Happy Path First**: "What's the normal success case?" (Product Owner leads)
   - Facilitator writes scenario live
   - All roles review in real-time
   - Adjust based on feedback

2. **Validation Failures**: "What could go wrong with inputs?" (Developer/QA)
   - Common: invalid format, missing fields, invalid references
   - Quick scenarios, add to board

3. **State Violations**: "What if system is in wrong state?" (Domain Expert)
   - Example: "Can't confirm if already confirmed"
   - These are business rules, often overlooked

4. **Alternative Paths**: "Are there other ways this could work?" (Product Owner)
   - Different paths through the same command
   - Different outcomes based on business logic

5. **Error Handling**: "What if external systems fail?" (Developer)
   - Payment decline, inventory unavailable
   - Recovery/retry scenarios

6. **Compensation**: "Can this be undone?" (Domain Expert)
   - Cancellation, reversal, refund flows
   - Often reveal missing events

**Review Style**:
- Each scenario read aloud by facilitator
- Quick check: "Is this right?" (Everyone nods or speaks up)
- Move forward—don't perfect, iterate later
- Target: 3-5 scenarios per command, 10-20 minutes per command

### Multi-Role Review

As scenarios are written, ensure each role checks:
- **Product Owner**: "Is this the right business behavior?"
- **Developer**: "Can we implement this? Need system state? Edge cases?"
- **QA**: "Can we test this? Is it clear enough?"
- **Facilitator**: "Do we have enough detail for coding?"

### Common Workshop Mistakes to Avoid

 **Perfectionism**: Don't spend 30 minutes on one scenario. Capture and move.
 **Missing roles**: One person can't represent all perspectives.
 **Too technical**: Use domain language, not code. Adjust in implementation.
 **Incomplete givens**: "Given an order" is too vague. Specify state.
 **Unclear events**: Every scenario must show what event is produced (or why not).

### Tips for Rapid Creation

 **Use templates**: Have sticky note templates with Given/When/Then pre-printed
 **Parallel work**: Different people write different scenarios simultaneously
 **Capture edge cases**: When someone says "What if...?" → immediately capture as scenario
 **Reference past decisions**: Point to event timeline and boundary diagrams
 **Record decisions**: Why did we choose this behavior? (Helps implementers later)

## Scenario Types

**Do not reduce scenarios to a simple good-case / bad-case pair.** For each command, ask the questions below and write a scenario for every answer that the business case supports. Which types apply and how many scenarios each type generates is always determined by the domain — not by a fixed count or a static rule.

| # | Type | Question to ask |
|---|------|----------------|
| 1 | **Happy Path** | "What is the normal success case?" |
| 2 | **Validation Failure** | "What invalid or missing inputs should be rejected?" |
| 3 | **State Violation** | "What if the system is in a state that makes this command invalid?" |
| 4 | **Duplicate Action** | "What if this command is issued again after it already succeeded?" |
| 5 | **Alternative Path** | "Are there different valid outcomes depending on context?" |
| 6 | **External Failure** | "What if an external system or scheduler fails during this command?" |
| 7 | **Compensation** | "Can this be undone or reversed? What triggers the cleanup?" |

Work through each question with the domain in mind. If the answer is "that situation cannot occur in this business" then no scenario is needed for that type — but that judgment must come from the domain, not from a desire to write fewer scenarios.

## Workflow

### 0. Decide GWT vs. storyline for every READMODEL — before drafting any scenario payload

Apply the decision test from "GWT vs. Storyline — Decision Rule" above to every READMODEL on the
board (or in scope). Produce a visible artifact — one line per READMODEL, "yes → storyline" or
"no → GWT-only" with a one-clause reason — before writing the first scenario payload, not as a
checklist review after. Deciding this list up front is what stops a batch pass from silently
collapsing into one reused schema for every command and read model alike.

For each command and view, write scenarios in Given-When-Then format:

The full worked example set for every category below (command scenarios, state validation, view scenarios, list-type views, error paths, compensation) lives in `references/examples.md` — one compact example per category is shown here.

### 1. Command Scenarios (Given-When-Then)
Specify command behavior:

```
Scenario: Create order successfully
Given a customer with ID "cust-123"
And products exist with IDs ["prod-1", "prod-2"]
When the customer creates an order with items:
    | productId | quantity | unitPrice |
    | prod-1    | 2        | 50.00    |
Then the order should be created with status "Draft"
And an "OrderCreated" event is produced with orderId, customerId, items, total, status

Scenario: Reject order with invalid customer
Given a customer ID "invalid-cust" that doesn't exist
When the customer tries to create an order
Then the command should be rejected, reason "Customer not found"
And no event is produced
```

### 2. Command Scenarios - State Validation
Specify how stream state affects command:

```
Scenario: Confirm order in Draft state
Given an order "order-456" in Draft state, OrderCreated event exists
When the customer confirms the order with payment method "card"
Then an "OrderConfirmed" event is produced with orderId, paymentMethod, confirmedAt

Scenario: Reject confirming already-confirmed order
Given an order "order-456" in Confirmed state, OrderConfirmed event already exists
When the customer tries to confirm the order again
Then the command should be rejected, reason "Order already confirmed"
```

### 3. View Scenarios (Given-When-Then)
Specify how read models display data:

```
Scenario: Display order after creation
Given an OrderCreated event with orderId, customerId, items, total
When the OrderStatusView processes this event
Then the view should display Order ID, Status "Draft", Total, Items, Created

Scenario: Accumulate payment information
Given OrderConfirmed event processed (status=Confirmed)
When a PaymentAuthorized event arrives with paymentId, authCode
Then the view should accumulate Payment ID, Auth Code, Payment Status "Authorized"
```

### 3b. List-type Read Model Scenarios
Specify expected rows and empty-list intent when the THEN readmodel is a list (`listElement: true`):

```
Scenario: Products list shows all created products
Given a ProductCreated event with name "Shoes", index "0"
When the ProductList view processes this event
Then the list should contain: | name | index | ... | Shoes | 0 | ... |

Scenario: Products list is empty after last item is deleted
Given a ProductDeleted event for the last remaining item
When the ProductList view processes this event
Then the list should be empty
```

### 4. Error Path Scenarios
Specify how system handles failures:

```
Scenario: Handle declined payment
Given an order "order-001" in Confirmed state
When the payment gateway declines the card
Then a PaymentFailed event is produced with orderId, reason, timestamp

Scenario: Allow retry after payment failure
Given a PaymentFailed event exists, order status is still "Confirmed"
When customer retries payment
Then the new AuthorizePayment command is accepted
```

### 5. Compensation Scenarios
Specify rollback/cancellation flows:

```
Scenario: Cancel order in Draft state
Given an order "order-555" in Draft state, only OrderCreated event exists
When customer cancels the order with reason "Changed mind"
Then an OrderCancelled event is produced with orderId, reason, cancelledAt

Scenario: Trigger compensation on cancellation
Given an order in Confirmed state, PaymentAuthorized event exists
When OrderCancelled event is produced
Then a RefundPayment command should be automatically triggered
And RefundInitiated event should follow
```

## Output Format

There is no markdown-document output for this step — the deliverable is the scenarios posted directly to the board's spec cells (see "Post Scenarios to Board" below), using the same command/view/list/error/compensation scenario shapes already illustrated in the Workflow section above (§1–5). Group scenarios under their command or view exactly as shown there; there's no separate presentation format to produce first.

## Post Scenarios to Board

After designing all scenarios, post them to the board using the timeline/column API. Do this for every command and view that has scenarios.

### Step 1 — Identify the target timeline and column

Fetch all CHAPTER nodes to find the timeline.

**Prefer MCP:**
```
mcp__eventmodelers__get_nodes { "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>", "type": "CHAPTER" }
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Post Scenarios to Board — Step 1: Identify the Target Timeline and Column".

If there is more than one chapter, ask the user which timeline to target.

For each command or view being specified, find its column: fetch the chapter node and read `meta.timelineData.columns`. Match the column to the COMMAND or READMODEL node that occupies the interaction row in that column. If the user named the slice, find the SLICE_BORDER node with that title to get its `colId`.

### Step 2 — Load valid step elements

For each target timeline, call spec-info to discover the node IDs that may appear in given/when/then.

**Prefer MCP:**
```
mcp__eventmodelers__get_spec_info { "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>", "timelineId": "<TL>" }
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Post Scenarios to Board — Step 2: Load Valid Step Elements".

Build a lookup map: `title (lowercase) → { id, type }`. Use this to resolve scenario step names to node IDs.

### Step 3 — Resolve step IDs

For each scenario step (given/when/then items), match the step title against the spec-info lookup. If a title matches unambiguously, use that node's `id`. If a title is ambiguous or unmatched, log it and skip that step item rather than failing — the scenario can still be posted with fewer steps.

See `learn-eventmodelers-api` for the full step item format, scenario object shapes, and edge cases (SPEC_ERROR, multiple spec rows).

### Step 4 — Post all scenarios for a column in one call

Group all scenarios for the same column and post them as an array. The SCENARIO spec node is created automatically — no pre-creation needed.

**Prefer MCP:**
```
mcp__eventmodelers__add_scenario {
  "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>",
  "timelineId": "<TL>",
  "columnId": "<COL>",
  "scenarios": [...scenario objects, same shape as below...],
  "compact": true
}
```
Pass `compact: true` — you already hold every scenario object you sent, so the response only needs to confirm `{added, scenarioCount, isNewNode}`, not echo all of them back. Same for `add_storyline`. Across a full pass posting scenarios for every command and read model column, this is the bulk of the step's response tokens.
`given`/`when`/`then` are arrays of `{id, title?, type?, ...}` objects — **not** bare nodeId strings (this differs from the raw REST body shown in the fallback below). The examples in Steps 4b/4c/§Rejection already use this object shape; pass them straight through as the `scenarios` array. For a state-view scenario whose `when` needs to represent a query rather than a COMMAND, `when` may hold a single inline object that is **not** a board node: `{"id": "<generated-uuid>", "type": "QUERY", "title": "...", "fields": [{"name": "...", "example": "..."}]}`. Same server-side rules apply either way (see below).

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Post Scenarios to Board — Step 4: Post All Scenarios for a Column in One Call".

**Rules enforced by the server (do not pre-validate — let the server reject):**
- `given`: EVENTs only
- `when`: at most one COMMAND; empty when `then` contains a READMODEL
- `then`: EVENTs only OR exactly one READMODEL — never mixed
- All step node IDs must belong to the same timeline

### Step 4b — List-type readmodel scenario fields

When `then` contains a READMODEL whose `listElement` property is `true` — set on the node when it was created, per `eventmodeling-core-rules`'s READMODEL section and `eventmodeling-identifying-outputs`/`eventmodeling-designing-automation-chains` — add two fields **at the scenario level** (not inside `then`):

**`examples`** — one object per expected row, keyed by the readmodel's snake_case field names. Without this the spec node renders with no expected output and the scenario is unverifiable.

**`expectEmptyList: true`** — when the expected result is an empty list (e.g. after a delete). Do not leave `examples: []` without this flag — an empty array alone is ambiguous ("no data provided yet" vs. "intentionally empty").

Non-empty list scenario:
```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "title": "Products list shows created items",
  "given": [{"id":"<eventNodeId>","title":"ProductCreated","type":"EVENT"}],
  "when":  [],
  "then":  [{"id":"<readmodelNodeId>","title":"ProductList","type":"READMODEL"}],
  "examples": [
    { "name": "Shoes",    "index": "0", "family_id": "22222..." },
    { "name": "Clothing", "index": "1", "family_id": "33333..." }
  ]
}
```

Empty list scenario:
```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "title": "No products remain after deletion",
  "given": [{"id":"<eventNodeId>","title":"ProductDeleted","type":"EVENT"}],
  "when":  [],
  "then":  [{"id":"<readmodelNodeId>","title":"ProductList","type":"READMODEL"}],
  "expectEmptyList": true,
  "examples": []
}
```

### Step 4c — Error/rejection scenarios

When a scenario represents a command being **rejected** (validation failure, state violation, or business rule rejection), set two fields **at the scenario level**:

**`expectError: true`** — signals that the command should be rejected and no event is produced. Set this for every failure/rejection scenario.

**`errorDescription`** — a short human-readable description of the expected error or rejection reason (e.g. `"missing required field: date"`, `"reservation already confirmed"`). Do not leave this empty when `expectError` is `true`.

When `expectError` is `true`:
- `then` must be `[]` — no events are produced on rejection
- `when` contains the COMMAND being rejected
- `given` contains any prerequisite EVENTs needed to establish the wrong state (may be empty for pure input-validation rejections)
- Do **not** set `expectEmptyList` — that flag is only for list READMODELs

Rejection scenario example:
```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "title": "Reject reservation with missing required date field",
  "expectError": true,
  "errorDescription": "missing required field: date",
  "given": [],
  "when": [{"id": "<commandNodeId>", "title": "Reservation Command", "type": "COMMAND"}],
  "then": [],
  "examples": [],
  "expectEmptyList": false
}
```

State-violation rejection (given events establish the wrong state):
```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "title": "Reject confirming an already-confirmed reservation",
  "expectError": true,
  "errorDescription": "reservation already confirmed",
  "given": [{"id": "<eventNodeId>", "title": "ReservationConfirmed", "type": "EVENT"}],
  "when": [{"id": "<commandNodeId>", "title": "Confirm Reservation", "type": "COMMAND"}],
  "then": [],
  "examples": [],
  "expectEmptyList": false
}
```

### Step 5 — Report back

After posting, tell the user:
- How many scenarios were posted successfully (per command/view)
- Any scenarios skipped due to duplicate title or unresolvable step IDs
- The `specNodeId` of each spec node created or updated

## Quality Checklist

**Per command — all 7 scenario types considered (skip only with explicit reason):**
- [ ] **Happy Path** — normal success case written
- [ ] **Validation Failure** — invalid/missing input rejected (or marked N/A with reason)
- [ ] **State Violation** — command issued in wrong system state (or marked N/A with reason)
- [ ] **Duplicate Action** — second issuance after success handled (or marked N/A with reason)
- [ ] **Alternative Path** — different valid outcomes captured (or marked N/A with reason)
- [ ] **External Failure** — external system failure handled (or marked N/A with reason)
- [ ] **Compensation** — reversal/undo flow written (or marked N/A with reason)

**No command has only 2 scenarios unless all other types were reviewed and found inapplicable.**

**Per read model — this is a separate, equally mandatory pass, not an afterthought of the command pass above:**
- [ ] **Every READMODEL on the board has at least one view scenario** — GWT (`given`: source EVENTs, `when`: empty, `then`: the READMODEL) or a storyline. A model with dozens of command scenarios and 0 read-model scenarios is not a complete Step 7 — it's easy to walk away thinking coverage is thorough because the command side looks exhaustive, so check the read-model side explicitly before reporting this step done.
- [ ] **Population scenario** — the view shows correct data after its source event(s)
- [ ] **Removal/update scenario, where applicable** — a row disappears or changes (`expectEmptyList: true` for list-type views) after an event that supersedes it (expiry, return, archival, withdrawal, status change, etc.). `EVENT → READMODEL` is exempt from column ordering **only when the read model already feeds an AUTOMATION** (`READMODEL → AUTOMATION` edge; see `learn-eventmodelers-api` §3 and `eventmodeling-orchestrating-event-modeling`'s "No backward arrows") — a later event connecting back to an earlier-placed todo-list read model is normal for that accumulator shape, so add the connection if it's missing rather than assuming the scenario is impossible. If the read model has no automation to feed, the backward connection is rejected — by Step 5 this should already have been modeled the forward way (see `eventmodeling-identifying-outputs` Step 5g's copy pattern: a new read model + screen copy in the later event's column, never a link back). If it wasn't, write the scenario against that forward-placed copy rather than the original. Only skip this scenario, with a documented gap (TASK comment), when the superseding event genuinely lives in a different chapter.
- [ ] **GWT vs. storyline decided per read model, not applied uniformly** — apply the decision test from "GWT vs. Storyline — Decision Rule" above to each read model individually; some may qualify for a storyline while the rest of the same model are correctly GWT-only. Don't default to one format for every read model just because it worked for the first one.
- [ ] **No redundancy or contradiction between a read model's GWT scenarios and its storyline** — if both exist for the same read model, read the storyline's beats before finalizing the GWTs. A GWT that asserts the same state a beat already shows is redundant (delete it); a GWT written without tracing the same causal sequence the storyline encodes can end up asserting something the storyline's beats actually contradict (e.g. claiming two entities coexist in a view when the storyline correctly shows one superseding the other) — delete or fix it, never leave a contradiction on the board.
- [ ] **Cross-context read models handled honestly** — if a read model's true source events live in a different chapter, `given` can't reference them (same-timeline-only, like connections); write the scenario with an empty `given` and say so explicitly in the scenario title, rather than silently omitting the scenario or fabricating a same-timeline event that isn't the real source

**Format and posting:**
- [ ] State preconditions are explicit in Given (not just "Given an order")
- [ ] Actions are clear in When
- [ ] Outcomes are verifiable in Then (event produced or rejection with reason)
- [ ] All scenarios posted to board spec cells via the `/scenarios` API
- [ ] **Workshop facilitation approach documented**
- [ ] **All stakeholder roles (PO, Dev, QA, Domain Expert) perspectives captured**
- [ ] **Edge cases suggested by participants captured**
- [ ] **Why behind business rules documented (not just the what)**

## Gherkin Best Practices

```
Good:
Given an order in "Draft" state
When the customer confirms the order
Then the status changes to "Confirmed"

Bad:
Given order
When stuff happens
Then it works

Good:
And an OrderConfirmed event is produced with:
    | field | value |
    | orderId | order-123 |

Bad:
And an event is produced

Good:
Then the command is rejected
And the error is "Customer not found"

Bad:
Then there's an error
```

## Key Principles

1. **One Scenario = One Test**: Each scenario is testable
2. **Explicit Preconditions**: State is clear in "Given"
3. **Clear Actions**: "When" describes user/processor action
4. **Verifiable Outcomes**: "Then" checks results
5. **Event-Centric**: Every scenario produces or updates events
6. **Business Language**: Use domain terms, not technical jargon
