description: Design and render a single real HTML/CSS screen (one or more pages) onto an HTML_SCREEN node — this is the default skill for any "design a screen" / "storyboard this" request; wireframe sketches (storyboard-screen) are used only when the user explicitly asks for one
---

# HTML Screen Designer

> **Before doing anything else**, invoke the `connect` skill — if not already connected — to resolve `TOKEN`, `BOARD_ID`, `ORG_ID`, and `BASE_URL`. Do not proceed until the connect skill has completed.

Prefer `mcp__eventmodelers__*` tools when available (registered by the `connect` skill) — the curl blocks below are the fallback for sessions without MCP connected.

> **DEFAULT SCREEN SKILL**: Reach for this skill on any ordinary "design a screen" / "storyboard this" request — it is the default, rendering a real HTML/CSS mockup onto an HTML_SCREEN node. Use `storyboard-screen` (a low-fidelity wireframe sketch onto a plain SCREEN node) **only** when the user explicitly asks for a "sketch", a "wireframe", a "low-fidelity mockup", or names the SCREEN node type directly.

> **MANDATORY RENDER**: The render call in Step 4 is **not optional**. This skill exists solely to produce rendered pages. An HTML_SCREEN node with no non-empty page is an empty placeholder that adds no value to the model. If the render call is skipped or fails, the task is incomplete — retry or report the error.

Design one or more HTML/CSS pages and render them onto an HTML_SCREEN node — creating the node if it doesn't exist yet, or updating it in place if it does. Use this to build a realistic, styled mockup (forms, tables, real page layout) rather than a wireframe sketch. Each page is a separate, standalone piece of markup — e.g. a multi-step form is one page per step, not one blob with hidden sections.

## Step 1 — Parse arguments

From `$ARGUMENTS`, extract:

| Field | How to find it | Default |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `description` | what the screen should contain, e.g. "checkout form with card number, expiry, CVC" | required |
| `boardId` | a board ID string | from `connect` skill (`BOARD_ID`) |
| `nodeId` | the HTML_SCREEN node UUID to update, if updating an existing screen | omit when creating a new one |
| `chapterId` | timeline UUID, required when creating a new node | **ask the user if missing and no `nodeId` was given** |
| `cellName` | spreadsheet-style cell, e.g. "B2", required when creating a new node | **ask the user if missing and no `nodeId` was given** |
| `baseUrl` | explicit URL override | from `connect` skill (`BASE_URL`) |

If neither `nodeId` nor (`chapterId` + `cellName`) can be resolved, ask the user before doing anything.

## Step 2 — If updating an existing screen, load its current pages first

If `nodeId` refers to a screen that already has pages (i.e. this is an adjustment/tweak, or "add a page" to an existing screen — not a brand-new screen), **do not design from scratch**. Load the node and inspect `meta.pages`.

**Prefer MCP:**

```
mcp__eventmodelers__get_node { "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>", "nodeId": "<NODE_ID>" }
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Step 2 — Load existing pages".

- If `meta.pages` is a non-empty array, use it as the base. For an edit to an existing page, change only that entry and keep the rest of the array untouched. For "add a page", append a new entry to the end of the array — never merge new content into an existing page.
- If it's empty or the node doesn't exist yet, design from scratch in Step 3.

Skip this step entirely when creating a brand-new node (no `nodeId` given) — go straight to Step 3.

## Step 3 — Design the page(s)

Write normal, full-size HTML/CSS for each page — as if designing a real webpage, not a tiny thumbnail. The canvas node renders this at a real page width and visually scales it down to fit, so there is no need to shrink font sizes or padding to fit a small box; design at a realistic scale (e.g. 16px body text, generous padding) and let the node handle the shrink.

Guidelines:
- **Keep it simple — this is a view-only mockup, not a working app.** No JavaScript, no interactivity beyond what a static page can show (enforced server-side, see below). Keep the CSS compact: inline styles or a handful of Bulma classes are enough — don't write a large embedded `<style>` block or reinvent what Bulma already gives you for free.
- Each page is one complete, standalone HTML fragment — not a `data-step` div nested inside a shared blob. A multi-step flow (e.g. cart → payment → confirmation) is three separate pages in the array, each fully self-contained.
- Inline styles (`style="..."`) are the simplest way to keep each page self-contained.
- No `<script>` tags, no inline event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, ...), no `javascript:` URIs — these are stripped server-side from every page before persisting regardless of what's sent. This is a static visual mockup, not an interactive prototype.
- A real page background (e.g. a light gray full-bleed background behind a centered white card) reads more realistically than a bare form floating on white.
- Don't add `<html>`/`<head>`/`<body>` tags to a page — every page is a body-only fragment. The canvas wraps each page in its own `<html><head>` (stylesheet + resize script) `<body>...</body></html>` at render time, so anything sent is placed inside that generated `<body>`.
- Bulma CSS (0.9.4) is loaded by default in that `<head>` — classes like `title`, `button`, `is-primary`, `field`/`control`/`input` etc. all work out of the box, no need to write custom CSS for standard form/layout components. Note headings need a size modifier too, e.g. `class="title is-1"` — a bare `title` class alone is always 2rem regardless of the tag (`h1` vs `h2` etc.).

### Marks — only when the user explicitly asks for one

The canvas has a native "Marks" feature (outline highlight, plus an optional "blur outside" or "white outside" spotlight) for calling out part of a screen — confirmed against the app's own source (`HtmlEditorModal.tsx`, `canvas/nodes/markHtml.ts`, `markBlur.ts`, `markStyles.ts`, `canvas/nodes/HtmlScreenNode.tsx`). **Do not add marks by default.** Only apply marks when the request explicitly asks to highlight/mark/call out/circle/spotlight, or blur/obscure/white-out part of the screen (e.g. "highlight the submit button", "blur everything except the email field", "white out everything but the header"), or when another skill's own instructions ask for a component to be marked/highlighted (e.g. `eventmodeling-identifying-outputs` Step 5c, which explicitly requests a mark per screen copy — that counts as an explicit ask). An ordinary "design a screen" request gets no marks.

**Never fake this with hand-written inline CSS** (`filter:blur(...)`, `outline:...`, `opacity:...`, `pointer-events:...` on page elements) — that is not how the native feature works and won't match how the app itself renders a mark. A real mark has **two halves that must both be set together**, in the same page/meta update:

**Half 1 — bake the mark onto the target element, inside the page HTML itself.** Pick the one element that should stay sharp (a row, a card, a tile — whatever the "component" is) and add two attributes to it, merging into any `class`/other attributes it already has:
- `data-em-mark-id="em-<short-unique-id>"` — a unique id for this mark, referenced by half 2 below.
- `class="em-mark em-mark-<colorhex-without-#>"` — e.g. `em-mark em-mark-e74c3c` for the default red `#e74c3c`. This class is what actually draws the `outline:4px solid <color> !important;outline-offset:1px;` — its stylesheet is injected by the app itself at render time, not something to write into the page.

Do not add any blur/white styling directly to other elements — that part is entirely driven by half 2.

**Half 2 — add the matching entry to `meta.marks`**, an array of objects (one per mark on this node, across all its pages):

```json
{
  "id": "em-<same-id-as-the-data-em-mark-id-attribute>",
  "color": "#e74c3c",
  "pageIndex": 0,
  "blurOutside": true,
  "whiteOutside": false
}
```

- `id` — must exactly match the `data-em-mark-id` value baked into the page in half 1. This is how the app's render script finds the marked element and applies blur/white to every *other* top-level branch of `<body>` (walking down, only recursing into branches that contain the marked element — see `markBlur.ts`'s `markOutsideScript`). No coordinates are needed or supported; targeting is purely by this shared id.
- `color` — must match the color used in the `em-mark-<colorhex>` class in half 1. Default `#e74c3c` (red) unless the user names one; other options mirror the app's mark picker: `#1e293b` (dark slate), `#2ecc71` (green), `#3b82f6` (blue), `#f1c40f` (yellow), `#ffffff` (white).
- `pageIndex` — which page in the `pages` array this mark's target element is on (0-based).
- `blurOutside` — `true` to blur every other top-level section (a spotlight effect). Mutually exclusive with `whiteOutside`.
- `whiteOutside` — `true` to collapse every other top-level section to solid white instead of blurring it. Use only when the user says "white out"/"whiteout" rather than "blur" — never set both `blurOutside` and `whiteOutside` on the same mark.

Set both halves in one `node:changed` call (or immediately paired calls) so the node is never left with one half but not the other:

```
mcp__eventmodelers__submit_node_events {
  "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>",
  "events": [{
    "id": "<event-uuid>", "eventType": "node:changed", "nodeId": "<NODE_ID>",
    "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>", "timestamp": <NOW_MS>,
    "meta": {
      "type": "HTML_SCREEN",
      "title": "<Screen Title>",
      "pages": ["<div>...<tr data-em-mark-id=\"em-abc123\" class=\"em-mark em-mark-e74c3c\">...crisp row...</tr>...</div>"],
      "marks": [{"id": "em-abc123", "color": "#e74c3c", "pageIndex": 0, "blurOutside": true, "whiteOutside": false}],
      "fields": [...]
    }
  }]
}
```

Pick a fresh, short random suffix for each mark id (`em-` + a few random alphanumeric characters) — don't reuse one across nodes/marks.

**Marked screens and field scoping**: when the same underlying screen is rendered multiple times as separate nodes — once per slice, each with a different mark calling out a different part of the UI — scope each node's `meta.fields` (Step 5 below) to only the data inside that node's marked area, not the full screen. Three slice-specific screen nodes sharing one visual base should end up with three different, narrower field lists, each matching what that node's mark calls out.

## Step 4 — Render the pages

**Updating an existing node** (`nodeId` was given) — always sends the **complete** pages array, not just the changed/new entry:

**Prefer MCP:**

```
mcp__eventmodelers__render_screen {
  "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>",
  "nodeId": "<NODE_ID>",
  "pages": ["<div>...</div>", "<div>...</div>"]
}
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Step 4 — Updating an existing node".

**Creating a new node** (no `nodeId` — one is generated and placed into `chapterId`/`cellName`):

**Prefer MCP:**

```
mcp__eventmodelers__create_screen {
  "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>",
  "contentType": "html",
  "nodeId": "<generated-uuid>",
  "chapterId": "<CHAPTER_ID>",
  "cellName": "<CELL_NAME>",
  "pages": ["<div>...</div>"],
  "fields": [ /* optional — set meta.fields here too (see Step 5) instead of a separate call */ ]
}
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Step 4 — Creating a new node".

Expect `204 No Content` on success from either curl call.

## Step 5 — Define field data lineage (mandatory)

Every screen — new or updated — needs `meta.fields`: one entry per piece of data the screen displays or captures, each with a `mapping` naming where that data comes from. A screen with only a title and no fields is an empty placeholder from a data-lineage standpoint, even if the mockup itself looks complete.

**For a brand-new screen** (Step 4's `create_screen` call), pass `fields` directly on that call instead of a separate `node:changed` here — one round trip instead of two. This step's separate `submit_node_events` call is still how you set/update fields on an **existing** screen (`render_screen` doesn't take `fields` either).

| Field type | `mapping` | Example |
|---|---|---|
| User types a value, sent as a command | `"<CommandTitle>.<fieldName>"` | `"ReserveBike.bikeId"` |
| Read from session | `"session:<fieldName>"` | `"session:customerId"` |
| Displayed data, sourced from a read model | `"<ReadModelTitle>.<fieldName>"` | `"ActiveReservationView.status"` |
| Calculated/formatted only for display | `"derived:<expression>"` | `"derived:formatDuration(durationMinutes)"` |

Name the read model even if it doesn't exist as a board node yet — this skill only renders the screen, it does not create READMODEL nodes or connections (that's `eventmodeling-identifying-outputs` or `place-element`, if the model is taken that far). But naming the source is **not optional**: a screen displaying data should almost never have a field with no mapping. If you can't say which read model a displayed field comes from, that's a sign the model is missing something — not a reason to skip the field.

If this node is one of several sharing the same visual base with different marks/highlights (see "Marked screens and field scoping" above), only list the fields that fall inside *this* node's highlighted area — not every field the shared screen shows.

Set `cardinality` too (`"Single"` unless the field is a repeated/list value), then push the fields onto the node:

**Prefer MCP:**
```
mcp__eventmodelers__submit_node_events {
  "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>",
  "events": [{
    "id": "<event-uuid>", "eventType": "node:changed", "nodeId": "<NODE_ID>",
    "boardId": "<BOARD_ID>", "timestamp": <NOW_MS>,
    "changedAttributes": ["meta.fields"],
    "meta": { "type": "HTML_SCREEN", "fields": [
      {"name": "status", "type": "String", "example": "confirmed", "mapping": "ActiveReservationView.status", "cardinality": "Single"}
    ] }
  }]
}
```

**Fallback (no MCP):** see `references/api-fallback.md` — "Step 5 — Define field data lineage".

## Step 6 — Report back

Tell the user:
- The node ID that was created or updated
- How many pages the screen now has
- Whether the render succeeded (HTTP 204)
- Any errors
