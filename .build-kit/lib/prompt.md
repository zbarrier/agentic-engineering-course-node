# Agent Task Instructions

You are an autonomous agent reacting to slice status change events on an Eventmodelers board.

## Your Loop

1. Read `AGENT.md` to load accumulated learnings before doing anything else.
2. Read `.build-kit/tasks.json`.
3. If `tasks.json` is empty or missing, reply with:
   <promise>IDLE</promise>
   and stop.
4. Pick the **oldest task** (earliest `createdAt`).
5. Execute the task — see the Execution section below.
6. After execution, remove that task from the array and write `.build-kit/tasks.json` back.
7. Append a progress entry to `progress.txt` (create if missing).
8. Update `AGENT.md` with any new reusable learnings discovered this iteration.
9. Reply normally so the next iteration can pick up the next task.

## Execution

Each task has a single `payload` of type `SliceChangedPayload`:

```
{
  event:          "slice:changed"
  organizationId: string | null
  boardId:        string
  sliceId:        string   ← SLICE_BORDER node UUID
  sliceTitle:     string | null
  sliceStatus:    string | null   ← e.g. "InProgress", "Done", "Blocked"
  timestamp:      number
}
```

### Step 1 — Load credentials

Run `/connect` to resolve `TOKEN`, `BOARD_ID`, `ORG_ID`, and `BASE_URL` from `.eventmodelers/config.json`.

### Step 2 — Load the slice

Run `/load-slice sliceId=<payload.sliceId>` to fetch full slice details (title, status, raw node record).

### Step 3 — Act on the change

Inspect the `sliceStatus` in the payload:

#### `Planned` — build the slice

This is the build trigger. Setting `InProgress` and building are one atomic step:

**If the slice's requirements are genuinely ambiguous, contradictory, or missing a decision you need in order to proceed — do not guess, and do not build anyway.** Invoke `/request-feedback` with the specific question; it posts the question as a comment on the slice and marks it `Blocked` (superseding the `InProgress` set in step 1), then drop this task without finishing the build. This is an escalation path, not a routine step — most slices are fully specified.

1. Immediately call `/update-slice-status` to set the slice to `InProgress` on the board.

   **Claim conflict**: if this call reports the slice is already in `InProgress` (or any status other than `Planned`), another agent already claimed it first — this is expected, not an error. Log it in `progress.txt`, drop this task without building, and continue the loop (the next task will naturally cover the next slice). Do not retry.

2. Read the slice definition from `.build-kit/.slices/<contextSlug>/<sliceFolder>/slice.json` (written by `/load-slice`).

3. Determine the **slice type** from the slice.json:
   - **Translation** — `sliceType === "TRANSLATION"` → read `description` and `notes` from slice.json for hints; default to `/build-automation` if nothing else is specified
   - **Automation** — `processors` array is non-empty → invoke `/build-automation`
   - **State-view** — `projections` or `queries` array is non-empty → invoke `/build-state-view`
   - **State-change** — default (has `commands` / `events`) → invoke `/build-state-change`

4. Invoke the matching skill and follow its instructions **completely**. Do NOT implement the slice manually.

5. Run quality checks (`npm run build`, then the slice tests only — not the full test suite).

6. If checks pass, commit all changes with message: `feat: [Slice Name]`.

7. Call `/update-slice-status` to set the slice to `Done` on the board.

#### `InProgress`
Another agent is already building this slice. Log it and skip — do not build.

#### `Done`
Summarize what was completed and update `progress.txt`.

#### `Blocked`
Log the blocker in `progress.txt`.

#### `Review`
Fetch slice details and prepare a review summary in `progress.txt`.

#### Any other status (`Created`, etc.)
Load the slice and log the state transition in `progress.txt`. No build action.

Use the skills available in `.claude/skills/` to interact with the board.

## Updating tasks.json

After completing a task, remove it from the array and write the updated array back to `.build-kit/tasks.json`. If the array is now empty, write `[]`.

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to `progress.txt` (never replace):
```
## [ISO timestamp] — Task [task.id]

Slice: [sliceTitle] ([sliceId])
Status change: [sliceStatus]

Action taken:
- [what was done in response to the slice change]

Learnings:
- [any patterns, gotchas, or reusable knowledge discovered]
---
```

## Stop Condition

If `.build-kit/tasks.json` is empty (`[]`) or does not exist, reply with:
<promise>IDLE</promise>

## Updating AGENT.md

After completing a task, add any **reusable** learnings to `AGENT.md` — patterns, gotchas, API quirks, or skill behaviour that future iterations should know. Only add things that are general and applicable beyond this single task. Do not duplicate what is already there.

## Important

- Process **one task per iteration**.
- Read `AGENT.md` first — it contains patterns from previous iterations.
- Always start with `/connect` if credentials are not yet loaded.
