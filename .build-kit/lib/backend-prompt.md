# Ralph Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project. You apply your skills to build software slices. You only work on one slice at a time.

The structure defined in the Project-Skills is relevant.

## Context Boundary (READ FIRST — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You work within **exactly ONE context at a time** — the one named in `.build-kit/.slices/current_context.json`.

- **ONLY** look for and build slices inside `.build-kit/.slices/<currentContext>/`.
- **NEVER** read, scan, or build slices from any other context directory, even if it has "Planned" slices, and even if the current context has no work left.
- A "Planned" slice in a *different* context (e.g. "Rename organization" while you are in "Board Invitations") is **NOT yours to build**. Ignore it completely.
- If the current context has no "Planned" slice, you are **done for this iteration** — reply `<promise>NO_TASKS</promise>` and stop. Do not go looking elsewhere. The context is only ever changed on the board, never by you.

## Your Task

0. Do not read the entire code base. Focus on the tasks in this description.
1. Read `.build-kit/.slices/current_context.json` to find the active context name, then read `.build-kit/.slices/<contextName>/index.json`. Every item in status "planned" is a task.
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Make sure you are on the right branch "feature/<slicename>", if unsure, start from main.
5. Pick the **highest priority** slice where status is **exactly** "Planned" (case insensitive). This becomes your PRD. Set the status "InProgress" in the index.json **and** update the slice status on the eventmodelers board using the `update-slice-status` skill (or MCP if available).
   **IMPORTANT: Only work on slices with status "Planned" in the CURRENT context. Never pick up a slice that is "InProgress", "Done", "Blocked", "Created", or any other status — even if it looks incomplete. If no slice has status "Planned" in the current context, reply with:**
   <promise>NO_TASKS</promise> and stop immediately. Do not work on other slices and do not switch to another context.
   **Claim conflict**: the board rejects the status update if the slice is already in the target status — this is expected: another agent claimed it first, racing you for the same slice. This is NOT an error. Do not stop, do not retry the same slice. Re-read `index.json` (or re-fetch via `load-slice`), pick the next-highest-priority slice still "Planned", and try claiming that one instead. Repeat until a claim succeeds or no "Planned" slice remains, in which case reply `<promise>NO_TASKS</promise>`.
6. Pick the slice definition from `.build-kit/.slices/<contextName>/<folder>/slice.json` as defined in the prd. Never work on more than one slice per iteration.
7. A slice can define additional prompts as codegen/backendPrompt. any additional prompts defined in backend are hints for the implementation of the slice and have to be taken into account. If you use the additional prompt, add a line in progress.txt
7. Determine the slice type and invoke the matching skill as defined in the **Building a Slice** section of `.build-kit/CLAUDE.md`. Do NOT implement manually.
8. Write a short progress one liner after each step to progress.txt
9. Analyze and Implement that single slice, make use of the skills in the skills directory, but also your previsously collected
   knowledge. Make a list TODO list for what needs to be done. Also make sure to adjust the implementation according to the json definition. Carefully inspect events, fields and compare against the implemented slice. JSON is the desired state. ATTENTION: A "planned" task can also be just added specifications. So always look at the slice itself, but also the specifications. If specifications were added in json, which are not on code, you need to add them in code.
10. The slice in the json is always true, the code follows what is defined in the json
11. slice is only 'Done' if business logic is implemented as defined in the JSON, APIs are implemented, all scenarios in  JSON are implemented in code and it
    fulfills the slice.json. There must be no specification in json, that has no equivalent in code.
12. make sure to write the ui-prompt.md as defined if defined in the skill
13. Run quality checks ( npm run build, npm run test ) - Attention - it´s enough to run the tests for the slice. Do not run all tests.
14. even if the slice is fully implemented, run your test-analyzer skill and provide the code-slice.json file as defined in the skill
15. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Slice Name]` and merge back to main as FF merge ( update
    first )
16. Update the PRD to set `status: Done` for the completed story in index.json **and** update the slice status on the eventmodelers board using the `update-slice-status` skill (or MCP if available).
17. Append your progress to `progress.txt` after each step in the iteration.
18. append your new learnings to `.build-kit/AGENTS.md` in a compressed form, reusable for future iterations. Only add learnings if they are not already there.
19. Finish the iteration.

## Escalating Ambiguity

**If the slice's requirements are genuinely ambiguous, contradictory, or missing a decision you need
in order to proceed — do not guess, and do not build anyway.** Invoke `/request-feedback` with the
specific question; it posts the question as a comment on the slice and marks it `Blocked` on the
board (overriding the `InProgress` set earlier), then stop this iteration without finishing the
build — reply `<promise>DONE</promise>` as if the iteration's work was to raise the question, not to
implement the slice. This is an escalation path, not a routine step — read the slice.json and the
matching build skill's own instructions fully first; most slices are fully specified and need none of
this.

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):

```
## [Date/Time] - [Slice]

- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase
better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section
at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important
learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update AGENTS.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby AGENTS.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
3. **Add valuable learnings that apply to all tasks** to the Agents.md - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:
    - API patterns or conventions specific to that module
    - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements
    - Dependencies between files
    - Testing approaches for that area
    - Configuration or environment requirements

**Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**

- "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"
- "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"
- "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"
- "Field names must match the template exactly"

**Do NOT add:**

- Slice specific implementation details
- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt
- Task speecific learnings like "- Timesheet approval requires: submitted=true, reverted=false, approved=false, declined=false"

Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- run 'npm run build'
- run 'npm run test'
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns

## Skills

Use the provided skills in the skills folder as guidance.
Update skill definitions if you find an improvement you can make.

## Specifications

For every specification added to the Slice, you need to implement one use executable Specification in Code.

A Slice is not complete if specifications are missing or can´t be executed.

## Stop Condition

**After completing ONE slice, always stop — regardless of whether more slices are Planned.** The ralph loop will invoke you again for the next slice. Never chain multiple slices in one iteration.

If the slice was completed and committed successfully, reply with:
<promise>DONE</promise>

If no slice has status "Planned" in the current context, reply with:
<promise>NO_TASKS</promise>
(Do NOT switch to another context to find work — stop here.)

If ALL slices in the current context are Done, reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

## Important

- If `.build-kit/.eventmodelers/config.json` is absent, skip all platform communication (MCP calls, `update-slice-status`, board sync) and continue working locally.
- Work on ONE slice per iteration
- Commit frequently
- update progress.txt frequently
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting

## When an iteration completes

Use all the key learnings from the progress.txt and update the `.build-kit/AGENTS.md` file with those learnings.
